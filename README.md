‚≠ê:**Welcome to my GitHub profile!**

I am a passionate and experienced üß†**Machine Learning Developer** with over 3 years of experience in developing and implementing machine learning models. My expertise lies in leveraging data-driven approaches to solve complex problems and extract valuable insights.

With a solid foundation in mathematics, and computer science, and a üìñMaster's degree in Artificial Intelligence from FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg, I possess a deep understanding of various machine-learning algorithms and techniques. I have worked on multiple projects in the domains of computer vision and natural language processing.

In computer vision, I have hands-on experience with __transformers, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)__, as well as techniques like object detection, segmentation, tracking, and recognition. I have also explored frameworks such as __PyTorch, sci-kit-learn, OpenCV, and Darknet__, enabling me to develop robust and scalable solutions.

In natural language processing, I have worked on tasks like text generation, and sentiment analysis and have implemented techniques such as __ Transformers (both GPT and Bert Style)regression, decision trees, random forests, Bayesian learning, and clustering__. I have utilized libraries like __pandas, NumPy, Flask, and Matplotlib__ for efficient data manipulation and visualization.

Additionally, my ongoing Master's program in **Artificial intelligence** has provided me with in-depth knowledge of advanced topics including **deep learning, pattern analysis, pattern recognition, reinforcement learning**, and more. I am continuously learning and staying up to date with the latest advancements in the field of machine learning.

I am enthusiastic about collaborating on innovative projects, tackling challenging problems, and applying state-of-the-art techniques to make a positive impact. If you're interested in discussing machine learning, computer vision, or natural language processing, feel free to reach out to me.
